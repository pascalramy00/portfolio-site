I was born to Lebanese parents in Warsaw, Poland, but my journey eventually led me to Montreal, where I earned a Computer Science degree from **McGill University**. While studying, I worked in the service industry, sharpening my ability to adapt, communicate, and stay composed under pressure—skills that now serve me well as a developer.

Science has always fascinated me, but coding quickly became my craft. From my early projects to my time as a **Junior Developer** at **MyWallet Mobile** and as a **freelancer**, I’ve built and refined real-world applications, gaining extensive hands-on experience. Now, I’m gradually bringing all my work together into this portfolio site.

Lately, my focus has been on crafting **creative, dynamic front-end layouts** that enhance user experience and engagement, alongside **scalable, cross-platform applications** powered by **headless CMS**. But I’m always learning—pushing myself to explore new tools, techniques, and technologies.

Fluent in **English, French, and Polish,** with conversational **Arabic and Spanish**, I thrive in diverse, collaborative environments. And if years in the service industry taught me anything, it’s that patience is a superpower (which, as any developer knows, comes in handy when debugging at 2 AM).

This site is just the beginning. If you’d like to connect, collaborate, or chat about ideas, feel free to reach out!
